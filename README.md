## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
creat a repositori in git hub , clone it on the v code and create branche and switch from the master to the capston projects branch
add index.html.
add about.html
add styles.css.
add about.css.
add javascript file main.js
add  files readme , linters file , stylelintrc.json, package.json.
coding the html code and css style to make the desktop version portfolio


### Setup
after that i created capston projects branch  , i started to make the web design.
using the html codes and the css style.

### Install
I clone it by using the git bash inside the folder of my portfolio.
### Usage
i have made my capston project by html and styles css and javascript files  creating the index.html about.html  and styles.css files & about.css.
in the main.js and main.js I added the code of java script to make the menu berger  working normaly, so when its mobile version , its looks like the menu as three lines , so you click on it and you can see the menu items.
Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
Mobile: up to 768px wide.
Desktop: 768px or wider.

Links:
The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
The logo in the header links to the home page.

Mobile menu:
When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.

Dynamic page
The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.

I added all the files readme , linters file , stylelintrc.json, package.json.
### Run tests
i used the command git add .
git commit
git push
